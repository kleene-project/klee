## Description
The main process inside the container will receive `SIGTERM`, and after a grace
period, `SIGKILL`. The first signal can be changed with the `STOPSIGNAL`
instruction in the container's Dockerfile, or the `--stop-signal` option to
`docker run`.

## Examples
```console
$ docker stop my_container
```
